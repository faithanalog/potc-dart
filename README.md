# Prelude of the Chambered in Dart

Play it [here](http://potc.unknownloner.com/).

Based on this java code by Notch: [https://github.com/skeeto/Prelude-of-the-Chambered](https://github.com/skeeto/Prelude-of-the-Chambered)

This code is really ugly right now, but it matches the feature set of
the original game. I'm going to be refactoring it whenever I have the
time to be more organized. A lot of the game logic was copied
straight from the source of the original Prelude of the Chambered
by Notch, but the rendering code had to be rewritten for the most part
to work with webgl.

This code uses DTMark extensively for texture loading, audio, and sprite batching.
