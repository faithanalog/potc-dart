# Prelude of the Chambered in Dart!!!

Play it [HERE](http://potc.unknownloner.com/)

This code is really ugly right now, but it matches the feature set of
the original game. I'm going to be refactoring it whenever I have the
time though to be more organized. Most of the game logic was copied
straight from the source of the original Prelude of the Chambered
by Notch.
